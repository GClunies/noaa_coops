`noaa_coops` is a Python wrapper for the NOAA CO-OPS Tides &amp; Currents [Data](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/)
and [Metadata](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/mdapi/latest/) APIs.


This package is an evolution of [py_noaa](https://github.com/GClunies/py_noaa), the main addition being the creation of a `Station` class that is central to 
 `noaa_coops` and provides distinct advantages over `py_noaa`.

## Use
---
All data and metadata is handled using a `Station` class with methods and 
attributes for retrieving metadata, observed data, and predicted data.

### Getting Metadata

All available metadata for a desired station (identifed by unique `stationid`) 
is automagically generated when a `Station` object is initialzed. Station IDs 
can be found using the mapping interface at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/.
All metadata is stored as a dictionary in the `.metadata` attribute of a 
`Station` object for easy exploration (e.g. `seattle.metadata`). Additionally, 
the keys of the metadata attribute dictionary are also assigned as attributes 
of the station object itself (easily explored using tab-completion in your IDE).
For example:

```python
>>> from pprint import pprint  # For pretty printing
>>> import noaa_coops as nc
>>> seattle = nc.Station(9447130)
>>> pprint(seattle.lat_lon['lat'])
47.601944
>>> pprint(seattle.lat_lon['lon'])
-122.339167

```

### Getting Observed or Predicted Data
Station data can be retrieved using the `.get_data` method on a `Station` 
class object. Data is returned as a Pandas DataFrame for easy use and analysis. 
Data types are listed on the [NOAA CO-OPS Data API](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/#products). The data types currently supported for retrieval with `noaa_coops` are:

    - Currents
    - Observed water levels
    - Observered daily high and low water levels (use `product="high_low"`)
    - Predicted water levels
    - Predicted high and low water levels
    - Winds
    - Air pressure
    - Air temperature
    - Water temperature

Compatibility with other data products may exist, but is not guaranteed at this
time. Feel free to submit a pull request if you would like to add addtional 
functionality.

In the example below, water level data is retrieved for the Seattle station (`stationid`=9447130) for a 3 month period.

```python
>>> import noaa_coops as nc
>>> seattle = nc.Station(9447130)
>>> df_water_levels = seattle.get_data(
...     begin_date="20150101",
...     end_date="20150331",
...     product="water_level",
...     datum="MLLW",
...     units="metric",
...     time_zone="gmt")
>>> df_water_levels.head()  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
                     water_level  sigma    flags QC
